# SystemlevelProgramming-in-C-BitwiseOperartor

[1] Write a program which accept one number from user and count number of ON (1) bits in it without using % and / operator.\
  Input : 11\
  Output : 3

[2] Write a program which checks whether 15th bit is On or OFF.\

[3] Write a program which checks whether 7th & 15th & 21st , 28th bit is On or OFF.\

[4] Write a program which checks whether 7th & 8th & 9th bit is On or OFF.\

[5] Write a program which accept one number from user and off 7th and 10th bit of that number. Return modified number.\
  Input : 577 \
  Output : 1 

[6] Write a program which checks whether first and last bit is On or OFF. First bit means bit number 1 and last bit means bit number 32.\
